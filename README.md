# Horiseon Landing Page

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible and improve the SEO.

Through this project, I learnt a lot about the Scout's code, how to improve the readability of code, using proper semantic HTML elements,
consolidating CSS code, testing code line-by-line to observe and understand the effects of each segment, and finally, consolidating CSS code by removing or optimizing redundant segments.

## Installation

N/A, a web browser will do.

## Usage

The descriptions of each service Horiseon offers, as well as the benefits of such services, are illustrated at the center of the webpage. Feel free to use the links at the top right of the page to jump to the specific service you desire.
